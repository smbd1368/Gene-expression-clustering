# Gene-expression-clustering
The knowledge on the behavior of genes is necessary to learn the nature of cellular functions. Most data mining algorithms developed for microarray gene expression data deal with the difficulty of clustering. Cluster analysis of gene expression data helps to identify co-expressed genes. Analysis of these data sets reveals genes of unknown functions and the discovery of functional relationships between genes. Co-expressed genes can be grouped into clusters, based on their expression patterns of genes. Clustering is performed based on genes and samples. In gene clustering, the genes are treated as the objects, while the samples are the features. In sample clustering, however, the samples are divided into homogeneous groups where the genes are regarded as features. The most popular clustering algorithms in microarray gene expression analysis are hierarchical clustering (single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage), kmeans clustering,
